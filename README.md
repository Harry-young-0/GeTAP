# Tissue-and-Trait-Databases
Database of Tissues and Traits and their groupings

This simple repository is a way of storing the tissue and trait databases I built whilst designing the pipeline (add git link here).
These are free to download to your file system or can be accessed via github (coded within the pipeline - INCOMPLETE March21)
